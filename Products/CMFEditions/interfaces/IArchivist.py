    """Repository Purge Support

    Purging a version removes that version irrevocably.

    Adds ``purge`` method and extends the signature of the ``isUpToDate``,
    ``retrieve``, ``getHistory`` and ``queryHistory`` methods.
    The defaults of the extended methods mimique the standard behaviour of
    the original methods.

    With the introduction of purging two selection scheme exist for
    retrieving versions. Either purged versions are taken into account
    or not:

    - By passing ``countPurged=True`` purged versions are taken into
      account when accessing a version. When a purged version is accessed
      the storage tool decides what to do.
    - By passing ``countPurged=False`` purged versions are **not taken into
      account** when accessing a version.

    Example:

    An object got saved ten times. Two versions got purged in earlier
    calls. The history looks like this (``s`` means: depends on storage,
    ``e`` means: exception raised)::

      countPurged==True:

        selector:          0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
